            <h3 class="a7">Types of Coffee</h3>
            <p>Most types of coffee drinks comprise three common ingredients: espresso, steamed milk, and foam.
                Additional toppings can be added to each coffee type based on your customers’ unique preferences. The
                following are just some of the coffee drink definitions and possible cup pairings you may consider
                adding to your coffee shop menu. <br>It’s important to note that drink ratios may vary from coffee shop
                to
                coffee shop.</p>
            <div class="a9">
                <h3>Espresso</h3>
                <p>The espresso, also known as a short black, is approximately 1 oz. of highly concentrated coffee.<br>
                    Although simple in appearance, it can be difficult to master.</p>
                <strong>
                    Ratio: 1 shot of espresso<br>
                    Cup: 2-4 oz. Espresso Cup
                </strong>
                <img src="./image/espersso.jpg" alt="" class="a10">
                <h3>Americano</h3>
                <p>Americanos are popular breakfast drinks and thought to have originated during World War II.
                    <br>Soldiers
                    would add water to their coffee to extend their rations farther. The water dilutes the <br>espresso
                    while still maintaining a high level of caffeine.
                </p>
                <strong>
                    Ratio: 1 shot of espresso + 3 oz. of hot water<br>
                    Cup: 5-6 oz. Glass Coffee Mug
                </strong>
                <img src="./image/americano.jpg" alt="" class="a11">
                <h3>Macchiato</h3>
                <p>The word macchiato means mark or stain. This is in reference to the mark that steamed milk leaves
                    on<br>
                    the surface of the espresso as it is dashed into the drink. Flavoring syrups are often added to the
                    drink<br>according to customer preference.</p>
                <strong>Ratio: 1 shot of espresso + 1 to 2 teaspoons of steamed milk<br>
                    Cup: 3 oz. Glass Espresso Cup</strong>
                <img src="./image/macchinto.jpg" alt="" class="a12">
                <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
                <p>This creamy coffee drink is usually consumed at breakfast time in Italy and is loved in the<br> United
                    States as well. It is usually associated with indulgence and comfort because of its <br>thick foam layer
                    and additional flavorings that can be added to it.</p>
                <strong>Ratio: 1-2 shots of espresso + 2 oz. of steamed milk + 2 oz. of foamed milk + sprinkling of <br>chocolate powder (optional)<br>
                    Cup: 6-8 oz. Cappuccino Mug</strong>
