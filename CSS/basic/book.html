        <h2>Jonathan Swift</h2>
        <p>Gulliver's Travels began life not as the work of a single man, but as a group project. The idea originated
            with the Scriblerus Club, a group including Swift, John Gay, Alexander Pope and John Arbuthno. The
            Scriblerus Club was a group of writers and wits devoted to satirising what they perceived as the folly of
            modern scholarship and science. They invented an author and pedant called Martinus Scriblerus.</p>
